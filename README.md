# Amphetamine Beta
This is the distribution channel for beta builds of the macOS app Amphetamine.

[Amphetamine](https://apps.apple.com/app/amphetamine/id937984704?mt=12) is a macOS app that is distributed through the Mac App Store. Apple does not provide a [TestFlight service](https://developer.apple.com/testflight/) for macOS like they do for iOS, however, and thus I distribute beta versions of Amphetamine through this Github page.

# FAQs:<BR>
<!--- 
<b>Why is there no beta versions of Amphetamine available?</b><BR>
Historically, most Amphetamine releases have not not available for beta testing. I do not anticipate making every update to Amphetamine available to the public for beta testing. Only releases with substantial changes will typically be available on Github and, generally speaking, will only be available for a short period of time.
--->  
<b>Do beta builds of Amphetamine Expire? Why?</b><BR>
Yes, they do. Typically, the expiration occurs about a month after the build is created. I don't want this Github page to become an alternative to the Mac App Store where people are requesting that I provide new beta versions. Amphetamine's distribution channel is the Mac App Store and I do not want to change that at this time.

<b>Is it safe to download a beta version of Amphetamine?</b><BR>
Beta versions of Amphetamine are code-signed and are notarized by Apple. If you feel uncomfortable with downloading software from outside of the App Store, that's ok. Nobody is forcing you to do it. Just wait for the official release in the App Store.

<b>Are beta versions of Amphetamine stable?</b><BR>
Generally, yes, they should be. I have already done a lot of the beta testing myself. I can't find every bug, though. That's why I need your help.

<b>How can I help test beta versions of Amphetamine?</b><BR>
A big help would be for you to just simply test all of the things you normally use Amphetamine for. If you want to go above and beyond, I could really use help testing older versions of macOS (10.11 → 10.14), and testing a variety of different Macs (iMac, Mac mini, Mac Pro, MacBook(s) +/- Pros/Airs, etc.). You can use the pre-release release notes at the top of this page for general guidance on new features that could use testing. Making sure the "old" features still work is important too, though.

<b>How to I report issues/bugs I experience when using  beta version of Amphetamine?</b><BR>
I would prefer you submit a ticket/bug report on [Amphetamine's support site](https://iffy.freshdesk.com).
